        <p >General Information</p>
        <p >&#160;</p>
        <p >The Cooling Module has been specifically designed as a stand alone, portable refrigerat- ed apparatus for use with the CHEF-DR® II, CHEF-DR III, GenePath®, and CHEF Mapper® pulsed-field instruments. Electrophoresis buffer is circulated from the electrophoresis chamber by the variable speed pump, cooled directly by the liquid refrigerant in a heat exchanger within the Cooling Module, and returned to the electrophoresis chamber. The heat exchanger is electrically isolated from the chassis, compressor, and plumbing to eliminate electrical shock hazard.</p>
        <p >&#160;</p>
        <p >The Cooling Module maintains a constant buffer temperature typically within 1 °C of the set temperature (after stabilization) in an operating range of 5–25 °C for a total buffer capacity of 2.2 liters at a flow rate of 1.0 liter/minute. Maximum buffer cooling capacity is</p>
        <p >75 Watts (255 BTU) of input power at a set temperature of 14 °C</p>

        <p >Section 4</p>
        <p >Maintenance</p>
        <p >&#160;</p>
        <p >When the Cooling Module will not be used for an extended time, rinse the heat exchanger throughly with distilled water to remove all traces of electrophoresis buffer. Drain the residual water from the heat exchanger, and dry it with laboratory air.</p>
        <p >&#160;</p>
        <p >&#160;</p>
        <p >Section 5</p>
        <p >General Instructions</p>
        <p >&#160;</p>
        <p >5.1 Installation</p>
        <p >The Cooling Module is supplied with 2 two-foot lengths of 1/4" tubing, two 1/4" tubing clamps, and two 3/8" to 1/4" reducers. Bio-Rad recommends that the Cooling Module be prepared for installation as follows:</p>
        <p >&#160;</p>
        <p >1)&#160;  Attach one of the two-foot lengths of 1/4” flexible tubing to the “FLOW IN” port (Figure</p>
        <p >1B) and attach the other length to the “FLOW OUT” port (Figure 1C) of the Cooling Module. Be sure that the tubing is firmly seated against the rubber grommet to prevent accidental contact with the metal heat exchanger, and avoid putting undue stress on the ports. If the tubing ever needs to be removed, slit the tubing with a sharp knife or razor blade, rather than pulling it off.</p>
        <p >&#160;</p>
        <p >2)&#160;  Secure one 1/4" clamp onto the end of each length of tubing attached to the Cooling Module. The clamp must be secure to prevent air leakage into the buffer circulation system.</p>
        <p >&#160;</p>
        <p >3)&#160;  Insert one 3/8" to 1/4" reducer into the other end of the “FLOW IN” tubing.</p>
        <p >&#160;</p>
        <p >&#160;</p>
        <p >The Cooling Module can now be added to the CHEF buffer circulation system as follows (see figure 2):</p>
        <p >&#160;</p>
        <p >1)&#160;  Attach the buffer inflow tube (3/8" tube from the left front connector of the electrophoresis chamber) to the reducer on the end of the tubing attached to the “FLOW IN” port. The maximum total recommended length of tubing from the chamber connector to the “FLOW IN” port is 4 feet.</p>
        <p >&#160;</p>
        <p >2)&#160;  Attach the length of tubing from the “FLOW OUT” port of the Cooling Module to the inflow port of the recirculating pump.</p>
        <p >&#160;</p>
        <p >3)&#160;&#160; The maximum total recommended length of tubing from the outflow port of the recirculating pump to the electrophoresis chamber is 4 feet. Cooling capacity and efficiency will increase if shorter overall lengths of tubing are used.</p>
        <p >&#160;</p>
        <p >This configuration is recommended (as compared to having the buffer flow through the pump first into the Cooling Module) for the following reason. Residual buffer (from a previous run) can freeze in the heat exchanger of the Cooling Module if it is turned on, but the recirculating pump is not. This frozen buffer will block the flow of buffer from the pump to the Cooling Module, and may cause the tubing between the pump and Cooling Module to come loose or burst. This could result in leakage of gel buffer from the system. In the recommended configuration, no buffer will be drawn into the pump if a blockage occurs.</p>
        <p >&#160;</p>
        <p >&#160;</p>

        <p >&#160;</p>
        <p >&#160;</p>
        <p >5.2 Electrophoresis Chamber Internal Temperature Probe</p>
        <p >The internal temperature probe monitors buffer temperature in the electrophoresis chamber. If the electrophoresis cell’s internal temperature probe is connected to the Cooling Module, buffer temperature will be automatically monitored at the cell’s internal probe. There is a 9-pin connector on the back of the Cooling Module for the cell’s internal temperature probe. Buffer temperature is also automatically monitored at the “FLOW OUT” port (Figure 1C) of the Cooling Module by its own internal temperature sensor.</p>
        <p >&#160;</p>
        <p >&#160;</p>
        <p >5.3 Operation</p>
        <p >After the Cooling Module has been connected, the following steps should be followed for optimal operation.</p>
        <p >&#160;</p>
        <p >1)&#160;  Switch on the recirculating pump, and adjust flow rate to 1.0 liter/minute (setting of 70–80).</p>
        <p >&#160;</p>
        <p >2)&#160;  Switch on the Cooling Module (main power switch is on the front panel of the unit). The temperature display will read “14.0” after ten beeps, indicating that the unit is on (Figure 3A), and the red light above the “SET TEMP” button will illuminate (Figure 3B).</p>
        <p >&#160;</p>
        <p >3)&#160;  Enter the desired run temperature (14 °C is recommended) by pressing the “LOWER” or</p>
        <p >“Raise” button (Figure 3F) until the desired number is reached.</p>
        <p >&#160;</p>
        <p >4)&#160;  After 100 seconds have elapsed, the compressor will engage (if the set temperature is below ambient temperature), and the red light above “COOLING” will illuminate (Figure</p>
        <p >3D). This 100 second delay allows pressure equalization in the system to avoid mechanical damage.</p>
        <p >&#160;</p>
        <p >5)&#160;  Press the “ACTUAL TEMP” button (the red light above the button will illuminate; Figure</p>
        <p >3C) to read the current temperature monitored at the internal temperature probe (located in the “FLOW OUT” port), or at the Cell’s internal temperature probe (if connected).</p>
        <p >&#160;</p>
        <p >6)&#160;  After the Cooling Module has cooled the buffer to the desired set temperature, the “COOLING” light will occassionally go on and off accompanied by a click. This is an indication of the refrigerant bypass valve cycling on and off to maintain average buffer temperature within 1 °C of set temperature. Greater temperature fluctuations may occur with longer tubing length, low buffer flow rates, and/or high amounts of input power and high ambient temperatures. However, the built-in adaptive algorithm will compensate for these conditions so that the average temperature is typically within 1 °C.</p>
        <p >&#160;</p>
        <p >NOTE: Please allow sufficient room for ventilation at both the front and rear of the unit. The cooling fan is located in the rear.</p>

        <p >&#160;</p>
        <p >&#160;</p>
        <p >Bio-Rad recommends that the buffer in the system be pre-cooled to the desired run temperature. The Cooling Module can quickly pre-cool the system, at an approximate rate of 0.75 °C/minute in the absence of input power to the recommended operating temperature of 14 °C (to pre-cool from ambient temperature to 14 °C only takes 10–15 minutes), and is designed to maintain set temperature during the run. If the buffer is not pre-cooled, the presence of input power (from the electrophoresis power supply) will greatly increase the time required to bring the system to the set temperature.</p>
        <p >&#160;</p>
        <p >Note: The 0.75 °C/minute pre-cooling rate decreases for set temperatures lower than</p>
        <p >14 °C.</p>

        <p >Main  Switch Fuse  Check</p>
        <p >&#160;</p>
        <p >1)&#160;  Turn the unit around so that the back of the unit is facing forward, and locate the black plastic assembly containing the power cord receptacle on the lower left corner.</p>
        <p >&#160;</p>
        <p >2)&#160;  Turn the unit off and remove the main power cord from the receptacle (grasp the female plug, not the cord, and pull gently).</p>
        <p >&#160;</p>
        <p >3)&#160;  Insert a small-bladed flat screwdriver into the narrow slot at the top and twist firmly. This slot can be seen from above when looking down at the main power cord receptacle. The front cover will open revealing two light gray fuse holders.</p>
        <p >&#160;</p>
        <p >4)&#160;  Using the screwdriver, gently pull the fuse holders forward (out). Remove the fuse from the holder and examine. If the fuse is obviously burned, replace it with a 6.3 Amp, 250 V Slo-Blo fuse (100/120 V) or 3.0 Amp, 250 V Slo-Blow fuse (220/240 V). Otherwise, check the fuse with a volt-ohmmeter.</p>
        <p >&#160;</p>
        <p >5)&#160;  Place the fuse holders back into the slots such that the arrows on the fuse holders points in the same direction as the two arrows on the inside of the front cover. Press the fuse holders firmly into place, then close the front cover by pressing firmly at the top corners.</p>
        <p >&#160;</p>
        <p >6)&#160;  Replace the power cord. The unit is now ready for operation. If the unit still does not turn on, or the fuse burns again, please contact Bio-Rad instrument service.</p>
