        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;">Usage Of Content</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;">THE ECLIPSE FOUNDATION MAKES AVAILABLE SOFTWARE, DOCUMENTATION, INFORMATION AND/OR OTHER MATERIALS FOR OPEN SOURCE PROJECTS (COLLECTIVELY "CONTENT"). USE OF THE CONTENT IS GOVERNED BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND/OR THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF LICENSE AGREEMENTS OR NOTICES INDICATED OR REFERENCED BELOW. BY USING THE CONTENT, YOU AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE CONTENT IS GOVERNED BY THIS AGREEMENT AND/OR THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF ANY APPLICABLE LICENSE AGREEMENTS OR NOTICES INDICATED OR REFERENCED BELOW. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF ANY APPLICABLE LICENSE AGREEMENTS OR NOTICES INDICATED OR REFERENCED BELOW, THEN YOU MAY NOT USE THE CONTENT.</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;">Applicable Licenses</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;">Unless otherwise indicated, all Content made available by the Eclipse Foundation is provided to you under the terms and conditions of the Eclipse Public License Version 1.0 ("EPL"). A copy of the EPL is provided with this Content and is also available at <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html">http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html</a>. For purposes of the EPL, "Program" will mean the Content.</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;">Content includes, but is not limited to, source code, object code, documentation and other files maintained in the Eclipse Foundation source code repository ("Repository") in software modules ("Modules") and made available as downloadable archives ("Downloads").</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;mc-hyphenate: never;">Content may be structured and packaged into modules to facilitate delivering, extending, and upgrading the Content. Typical modules may include plug-ins ("Plug-ins"), plug-in fragments ("Fragments"), and features ("Features").</li>
            <li style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;">Each Plug-in or Fragment may be packaged as a sub-directory or JAR (Java™ ARchive) in a directory named "plugins".</li>
            <li style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;mc-hyphenate: never;">A Feature is a bundle of one or more Plug-ins and/or Fragments and associated material. Each Feature may be packaged as a sub-directory in a directory named "features". Within a Feature, files named "feature.xml" may contain a list of the names and version numbers of the Plug-ins and/or Fragments associated with that Feature.</li>
            <li style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;">Features may also include other Features ("Included Features"). Within a Feature, files named "feature.xml" may contain a list of the names and version numbers of Included Features.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;">The terms and conditions governing Plug-ins and Fragments should be contained in files named "about.html" ("Abouts"). The terms and conditions governing Features and Included Features should be contained in files named "license.html" ("Feature Licenses"). Abouts and Feature Licenses may be located in any directory of a Download or Module including, but not limited to the following locations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;">The top-level (root) directory</li>
            <li style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;">Plug-in and Fragment directories</li>
            <li style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;">Inside Plug-ins and Fragments packaged as JARs</li>
            <li style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;">Sub-directories of the directory named "src" of certain Plug&#8209;ins</li>
            <li style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;">Feature directories</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;">Note: if a Feature made available by the Eclipse Foundation is installed using the Provisioning Technology (as defined below), you must agree to a license ("Feature Update License") during the installation process. If the Feature contains Included Features, the Feature Update License should either provide you with the terms and conditions governing the Included Features or inform you where you can locate them. Feature Update Licenses may be found in the "license" property of files named "feature.properties" found within a Feature. Such Abouts, Feature Licenses, and Feature Update Licenses contain the terms and conditions (or references to such terms and conditions) that govern your use of the associated Content in that directory.</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;">THE ABOUTS, FEATURE LICENSES, AND FEATURE UPDATE LICENSES MAY REFER TO THE EPL OR OTHER LICENSE AGREEMENTS, NOTICES OR TERMS AND CONDITIONS. SOME OF THESE OTHER LICENSE AGREEMENTS MAY INCLUDE (BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO):</p>

        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;text-align: justify;">THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;text-align: justify;">1. DEFINITIONS</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;text-align: justify;">"Contribution" means:</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;text-align: justify;">a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;text-align: justify;">b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;text-align: justify;">i) changes to the Program, and</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;text-align: justify;">ii) additions to the Program;</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;text-align: justify;">where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;text-align: justify;">"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;text-align: justify;">"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;text-align: justify;">"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;text-align: justify;">"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;text-align: justify;page-break-after: avoid;">2. GRANT OF RIGHTS</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;text-align: justify;">a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;text-align: justify;">b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;text-align: justify;">c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;text-align: justify;">d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;text-align: justify;">3. REQUIREMENTS</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;text-align: justify;">A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;text-align: justify;">a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;text-align: justify;page-break-after: avoid;">b) its license agreement:</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;text-align: justify;">i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;text-align: justify;">ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;text-align: justify;">iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;text-align: justify;">iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;text-align: justify;">When the Program is made available in source code form:</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;text-align: justify;">a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;text-align: justify;">b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;text-align: justify;">Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;text-align: justify;">Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;text-align: justify;">4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;text-align: justify;">Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;text-align: justify;">For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;text-align: justify;">5. NO WARRANTY</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;text-align: justify;">EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;text-align: justify;page-break-after: avoid;">6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;text-align: justify;">EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;text-align: justify;">7. GENERAL</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;text-align: justify;">If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;text-align: justify;">If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;text-align: justify;">All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;text-align: justify;">Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';font-size: 10pt;text-align: justify;">This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.</p>
